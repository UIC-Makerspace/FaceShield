# FaceShield
A laser cuttable face shield for healthcare workers facing shortages

The design is two simple pieces and doesn't use any additional materials (we have found shortages of elastic and tapes to be a problem). The top portion prevents splash over and was requested by our environmental health and safety office. The band is adjustable in size with four positions. It allows for wearing glasses, safety goggles, and masks. They are incredibly quick to make - 20 seconds or so per mask (laser cutter depending)

To assemble:

1: Lay the shield flat on a clean surface.

2: insert the tab on the band into the rectangle slot and pull taught.

3: Pop the very bottom of the tab back towards you so the side flaps are on the opposite side of the shield from the band and the bottom flap is on the same side as the band. Think a Pringle or saddle shape.

4: Hook the top splash shield into the band. The inside corners of the tabs work well but there are other options that can work depending on head shape.

5: Put the shield on and slide the wavy part of the band through the rectangle to fasten the band.

Material used is 0.005" PET sourced from McMaster Carr. The design should accommodate other thicknesses of PET or even other materials. We also tested the design with 0.010" PET and 0.010" Cellulose Acetate. 

We have tested the materials with hospital sanitizers (1 cup : 1 gallon bleach; CaviWipes). Both PET and Cellulose Acetate have held up through many rounds of sanitation without adverse effects. 

The inspiration for this design came from: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h6WlkQmBpClYxl8ALhX6QgyC4MXv_gm_8CsJsMSeZTI/edit
